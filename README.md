# Student Management System (MVC)

A full-stack Student Management System built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Overview

This application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on student records.  
It is structured using MVC architecture to maintain separation of concerns and improve scalability and maintainability.


## Features

- Create a new student
- View all students
- Update student details
- Delete a student
- Server-side validation using express-validator
- RESTful routing
- Bootstrap-based responsive UI
- MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- Deployed on Vercel
